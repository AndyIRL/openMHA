__openMHA 4.12.0__ is the 2020 major release of the software platform featuring:

### Reference algorithms

* A collection of openMHA configuration files is available that implement signal processing algorithms for hearing aids together with a Matlab tool to process own data or to reproduce the results of published studies such as  
 [Baumg√§rtel et al. (2015): _Comparing Binaural Pre-processing Strategies I: Instrumental Evaluation._](https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216515617916)  
 [Hendrikse et al. (2020): _Evaluation of the Influence of Head Movement on Hearing Aid Algorithm Performance Using Acoustic Simulations._](https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216520916682)


### Offline fitting tool

* For processing a large number of audio files with hearing aid signal enhancement adapted to custom hearing losses a new GUI-based Matlab/Octave tool is provided which guides users through the selection of sound files, audiogram, and fitting rule.



### Advanced system support

* An up-to-date [MAHALIA](http://mahalia.openmha.org/) image for Beaglebone Black single-board computers containing the latest release of openMHA and additional enhancements of the low-level audio interface control via alsa is available.   


### Extended documentation and tool set

* Documentation
	* Updated starting guide with information on 
		* how to write a basic openMHA configuration 
		* how to update openMHA
	* Browsable html documentation of developer manual available online
	* Improved compilation instructions for plugins with an example
	* Updated installation and compilation instructions
	* Improved plugin documentation, e.g. smoothgain_bridge, combinechannels, wavrec, fftfilter, wave2spec
    * New example: split plugin
	* Best practices for publishing and consuming AC variables

* Tool set 
	* NAL-RP based hearing aid fitting rule with variable compression ratios
	* Support of sparser gain matrices in dynamic compressor through logarithmic interpolation option in dc
	

### More plugins

* Windnoise detection and a basic removal mechanism
* lsl2ac: receive data stream using the labstreaminglayer protocol in openMHA  
* altconfig: allows pre-configuration of different processing modes 
* Several plugins to provide reference implementations mentioned above
    
### Increased robustness
* Extended system tests and unit tests
* Example of unit test implementation available
* Enhanced real-time runtime configuration updates

### Community support

* Early access to development versions of Linux builds
* Development branch is available on Github
