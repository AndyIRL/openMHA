__openMHA 4.6.0__ is the 2018 major release of the software platform.

Several features were added in this release:
 
### System support
In version 4.6.0 openMHA supports Windows operating systems. [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md#iv-compilation-under-windows-advanced) for compiling the software under Windows are provided.

[Debian packages for Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md#i-installation-from-binary-packages-on-ubuntu) are provided.

### Tools and documentation

[A manual for calibration of hearing aid output](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/openMHA_calibration_manual.pdf) was added. Octave/Matlab tools to generate an openMHA configuration according to the outcome of the calibration procedure as well as an configuration example for testing the calibration are provided.

The openMHA documentation has been updated following user feedback. In particular the hands-on example in section 4 of the [application engineer manual](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/openMHA_application_manual.pdf) has been simplified.

### New plugins

Extended data exchange capabilities: Two plugins - _ac2osc_ and _ac2lsl_ - have been added that enable data transfer using [Open Sound Control (OSC)](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) and [Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) protocols.

 
The _MHAIOJackdb_ plugin enables openMHA to work with blocksizes that differ from the setting in the JACK server for live-processing.  

The _addsndfile_ allows to mix sound from a file to a live audio signal.
