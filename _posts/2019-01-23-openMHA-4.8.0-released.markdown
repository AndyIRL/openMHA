information about the installers as well as instructions to include binary packages 
for Ubuntu Linux are found in the [openMHA installation manual](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md).

for all operating systems are provided in a separate document.


Furthermore the [documentation of openMHA plugins](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/openMHA_plugins.pdf) 
has been updated. In addition to the main categories, tags were assigned to each
