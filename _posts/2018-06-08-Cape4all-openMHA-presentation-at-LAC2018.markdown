The paper describes a new multichannel sound interface for the BeagleBone Black, "Cape4all". The sound interface has 6 input channels with optional microphone pre-amplifiers and between 4 and 6 output channels. The multichannel sound extension cape for the BeagleBone Black is designed and produced. An ALSA driver is written for it. It is used with the openMHA hearing aid research software to perform hearing aid signal processing on the BeagleBone Black with a customized Debian distribution tailored to real-time audio signal processing.
