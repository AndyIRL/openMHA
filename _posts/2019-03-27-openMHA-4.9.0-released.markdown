Release __4.9.0__ of __openMHA__ contains several new plugins, features, improved documentation and bug fixes. 
 
New plugins:
- *delaysum_spec*: realizes sub-sample delay
- *mconv*: partitioned convolution
- *fftfilter*: FFT-based FIR filter

An optional interactive mode has been added to the openMHA executable such that inputs can be passed directly in the terminal running the mha executable.  
Checks of overlap-add configurations were implemented to ensure preservation of amplitude under the transformation.

Improved [documentation of openMHA plugins](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/openMHA_plugins.pdf) of the *prediction_error* plugin
and the *split* plugin.  
The plugins that implement single-channel noise reduction (formerly known as noisePowProposed and timoSmooth) are renamed to *noise_psd_estimator* and *smooth_cepstrum* and plugin documentation has been extended.

For consistency and due to the frequency-domain implementation *delaysum_spec* the delaysum plugin has been renamed to *delaysum_wave*.

Bug fixes (also with thanks to user reports on [Github](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/issues)): 
- Matlab gui becoming non-responsive on error
- wrong handling of DC and Nyquist bin in FFTs
- thread-safety of wavrec
- crash in acPooling_wave
- webcam handling in example 09
