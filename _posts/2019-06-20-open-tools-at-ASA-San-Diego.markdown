### Special hands-on session on Open Source Audio Processing Tools for Hearing Research at ASA meeting San Diego Dec 2-6

We would like to make you aware of a special hands-on session on "Open
Source Audio Processing Tools for Hearing Research" that Volker Hohmann and
Chas Pavlovic organize at the ASA meeting in San Diego on Dec 2-6. Several
projects funded by the NIH under the "Open Design Tools for Speech
Signal Processing" call will present their tools. Hardware and software
that can be used to investigate novel fitting strategies and algorithms
for hearing devices, as well as for other applications, will be shown
and available for you to try.

If you are interested in these tools, please consider coming to the
session. You may also check the websites of the contributing projects:
