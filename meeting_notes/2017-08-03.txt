__Attendees:__
Tobias, Hendrik

1. References for plugins
	- Hendrik seeks papers on which implementations of methods in plugins are based (ideally)
	- if not available: describe methods in planned PlosOne manuscripts, e.g., smoothgainsbridge
	- We try to maintian a complete list of references for all processing methods available in openMHA 

2. http://earswideopen.net/ 	
	- Sounds like an interesting project, but seems to be not very active 
	
3. Plugin categories
	- Hendrik will have a look on that
	- tags instead of hierchy migth be a good approach

4. Mac OS support
	- Tobias provided installation steps
	- Hendrik tests and writes manual 
	- ... and answers user who brouht up that request

5. openMHA update from github
	- Is 'make clean' really needed after git pull and (4.5.0 --> 4.5.1)
	- Hendrik tries to reproduce this and provides log
	
6. Some points raised in the webconference with Chas and Louis
	
	- Test power consumption of mobile hardware available at HoerTech

	- Storage reuqirements of OS

	- 2 CPUs a 2 audio channels vs. 1 CPU with 4 channels
		- 2 CPUs: stereo audio codecs can be used, but synchronization in binaural link is an issue
		- 1 CPU: Synchronization is fine, but sampling rate might be low and 4-channel procesing is tricky
