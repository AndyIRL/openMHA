1. Documentation
	- technically running, robustness to be checked, some formatting issues 
	- It's not a bad idea to use what Giso did, in general the beast is under control
	- We have 
		- developers guide --> developers guide
		- general manual --> application engineers
		- MHA control (GUI) manual (no html)
	- We need new screenshots
	- update content
	- Figure out which years to use in license text
	- Try to make manuals complementary 

2. Unit tests
	- Tobias does this for frequency shifter plugin
	- There is no general rule for comparing Matlab and openMHA output
	- Use defined (non-random, on-the-fly-generated) signals
	- assert_almost.m
	- 1e-5 is a good number
	- Note if higher precision is possible

3. Fractional delay 
	- to realize fractional delay in delay-and-sum plugin
	- but introduces additional delay

4. Status of plugins included in openMHA
	- check list of plugins 
	- build .cfg?

5. Octave fitting GUI
	- Include
	- Select fitting rules
	- Tobias takes care of fixing fitting 
	- Rework data handling ()  
	- Don't store the whole history
	
6. Demonstrator for company showcase
	- show fitting GUI with multi-channel dynamic compressor

7. Support request for early adopter Stefan Stenfelt by Volker
	- release version including GUI and fitting rules via github, see how they do and offer support if something is not working

8. NIH report
	- Hendrik will ask for input when/if needed

9. Is there a common name for MatLab- and octave-language?
	- MatLab --> octave for openMHA

10. openMHA_doc repository?
	- No.
	- Generating documentation might be messy and prone to errors
	- ``` make doc ``` to be used
	- Provide documentation on openMHA.org
	
11. Unification of MHA-repositories

12. User issues
	- There are merge requests

13. Henning Schepker's feedback canceler
	- Ask Volker how to proceed

14. TODOs in documentation
	- Leave them if not resolved quickly
		
15.	Administration of gitHub requests
	- Tobias
	
	
Next time:
- Documentation for closed MHA
