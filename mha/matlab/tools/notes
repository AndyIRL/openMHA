Requirements:

- qt for GUI support, comes with octave version >= 4.0

If octave crashes, when GUI is started try

LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 octave

OR update mesa driver

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

=== Revert to original drivers ===
To revert to standard Ubuntu drivers type the following in a prompt shell:
$ sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
$ sudo ppa-purge ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers

- octave signal package is needed for some fitting rules

> sudo apt-get install octave-signal
In ocatve run 
> pkg load signal
at startup

In octave 4.2.1 I used
> pkg install -forge control
> pkg install -forge signal

==

- Error message
error: octave_base_value::convert_to_str_internal (): wrong type argument '<unknown type>'

is connected to the required use of the qt graphics toolkit 
http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?46466

--> Installed octave 4.2.1 manually - resolved

===

Issues:

% fitting rules that crash
- loudfit: gt_basic is missing
- CAMFIT: field 'frequencies' does not exist
- NAL: nl1.mex is missing

% Data handling
Whole client database is stored in a single file - makes octave slow
--> Use one-file-per-event approach?

% Data compatibility
Octave is not able to save complex structs in Matlab format!
Other formats are slow.


% Client data is not updated/ saved after editing audiogram!
